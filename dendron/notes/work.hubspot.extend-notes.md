Just posted the link to the recorded sessions in obodev. Can you take a look at the “Application tracking with HubDB, Custom Objects, and Coded Actions”.
Can you be prepared to do a quick 5 min overview of it for an internal meeting (mostly dev people) next week? (can be longer/more involved if you would like as well, but not necessary)

- High level what they talked about
- Any major takeaways
- Anything new you learned


## Overview

- Create a custom object using the UI
  - Only available for Enterprise clients.
  - Will show building an application using NodeJS that reads data from an external API and stores data in a custom object in HS.
  - HubDB row update using coded actions in a workflow.
  - Dynamic detail pages using HubDB.
  - Serverless functions and GraphQL to create and display associated records.
    - (wtf that's awesome)
