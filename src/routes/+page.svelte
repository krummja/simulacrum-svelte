<h1>Hi, I'm Jonathan!</h1>

<p>
  If you're on this page, welcome to my personal web space. It's currently under significant reconstruction. Previously, this site was built using the Vue frontend framework; I recently decided to give Svelte a try, and I liked it so much I decided to rebuild my site using SvelteKit.

<p>
  It'll probably be a good while before I get things into an acceptable state, but I am stoked to have a simple and straightforward process for tinkering on this site, so check back often!
